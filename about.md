My dad built our fist computer by dumpster diving in the early 90s. I learned how to spell "windows" in MS-DOS in the first grade. I have always had a passion for technology, computers and how to bend the rules. Working in cybersecurity was always a dream of mine. I love the continuous hunt for knowledge, the thrill of falling down the rabbit hole, and knowing that I'm helping a larger cause than myself.
